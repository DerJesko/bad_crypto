# bad_crypto

A bad crypto library written in Rust. I'm just implementing cryptography schemes I learned about in University.

Don't use it. Only a fool would use it. Don't even think about using it. It is insecure. Go somewhere else and enjoy life.

ToDo list:

- [x] Elgamal Public Key Encryption
- [x] Elgamal Homomorphic Public Key Encryption
- [ ] Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
- [x] RSA Public Key Encryption (kind of; not the secure one)
- [ ] Rabin Public Key Encryption
- [x] Regev Public Key Encrytion
- [ ] GSW Homomorphic Public Key Encryption
