# bad_crypto
A bad crypto library written in Rust. I'm just implementing cryptography schemes I learned about in University.

Don't use it. Only a fool would use it. Don't even think about using it. It is insecure. Go somewhere else and enjoy life.

ToDo list:

* [x] Elgamal Public Key Encryption
* [x] Elgamal Homomorphic Public Key Encryption
* [ ] Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
* [ ] RSA Public Key Encryption
* [ ] Rabin Public Key Encryption
* [ ] Naor-Yung Public Key Encryption
  * [ ] NIZK Proof
  * [x] implies Naor-Yung
* [x] Regev Public Key Encrytion
* [ ] Dolev-Dwork-Naor Construction
* [ ] From Tag-Based Encryption to IND-CCA2 Encryption
* [ ] Boneh-Canetti-Halevi-Katz Transformation
* [ ] Boneh-Goh-Nissim Cryptosystem
* [ ] Groth-Ostrovsky-Sahai NIZK System
